        <h2>Off-The-Plan Conveyancing Services</h2>
        <p>First Class Legal’s services for off-the-plan purchases are designed to protect buyers in complex transactions. Below is a breakdown of their offerings, tailored to 2025’s market.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-Signing Contract Analysis</strong></p>
        <p>They meticulously review Contracts of Sale and Section 32 statements, clarifying terms like sunset clauses, variation allowances, or body corporate fees. This prevents surprises, such as a $15,000 unexpected levy in a Queensland unit purchase.</p>
        <p><strong>Stamp Duty Optimization</strong></p>
        <p>They calculate stamp duty savings, such as Victoria’s 50% concession for off-the-plan homes under $1M or Queensland’s $7,000 exemption for properties under $550,000. This can save buyers tens of thousands.</p>
        <p><strong>Developer Progress Monitoring</strong></p>
        <p>They track developer milestones, protecting deposits against delays (common in projects taking 1-2 years). This ensures buyers aren’t left exposed if a project stalls.</p>
        <p><strong>Due Diligence Searches</strong></p>
        <p>Searches via Landata or Titles Queensland uncover title issues, planning restrictions, or developer compliance risks, ensuring the project is legally sound.</p>
        <p><strong>Settlement Coordination</strong></p>
        <p>Settlements via PEXA ensure instant title transfers, with precise rate adjustments for council, water, or body corporate fees. They notify authorities post-settlement for clean ownership records.</p>
        <p><strong>Tailored Buyer Support</strong></p>
        <p>They guide first-home buyers on grants (e.g., $31,200 in Victoria) and investors on GST implications, ensuring informed decisions. For example, a buyer in Brisbane’s West End benefits from their sunset clause advice, avoiding a terminated contract.</p>
        <p>Scenario: A buyer purchasing a $1M Melbourne CBD apartment relies on First Class Legal to review the contract, secure $25,000 in stamp duty savings, run $500 in searches, monitor developer progress over 18 months, settle via PEXA, and notify Melbourne City Council, ensuring a secure investment.</p>
